You are receiving this message because your email is associated with an api key on https://doarama.com. 


When you were first provided with your API key, Doarama was a small project at NICTA/CSIRO, a government funded organization in Australia. In December 2017, we became an independent company and what was a team of one has grown to a team of 4. 


In the coming weeks we will be moving all Doarama data to our new site https://ayvri.com and we have been onboarding our early commercial api users on ayvri.com, including MountainHub, DroneLogBook, WingsForLife and more.  We have some more big announcements on the way. 

The ayvri API is a commercial use api. With the high cost of map and terrain data, we are currently unable to provide a free to use api. If you are interested in moving your api account to a paid ayvri, please contact us. 


On August 31st we will be decommissioning the Doarama and you will no longer be able to create 3d visualisations using your api key. All links will be redirected to https://ayvri.com. 


We thank you for your support and hope to see you on ayvri.com
